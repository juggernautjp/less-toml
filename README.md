## Less-TOML is a fork of Better TOML

I recommended to use https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml for better alternative of `Better TOML`.


# Less-TOML README

`Less TOML` is a fork of `Better TOML` for minimum TOML support (especially for Syntax Highlight).
`Better TOML` is a VS Code extension to support TOML files.

## Features

- Syntax Highlighting for `.toml` files
- Syntax Highlighting for TOML frontmatter and fenced code in Markdown


## Notice

The following feature of Better TOML is deleted.

- Syntax Validation for invalid input


## Less-TOML v0.5.0

Less-TOML v0.5.0 use https://github.com/textmate/toml.tmbundle/blob/master/Syntaxes/TOML.tmLanguage.
It is better (precise) than that of Better-TOML.
But at some points, it is less readable than Better-TOML (ex. Table).
